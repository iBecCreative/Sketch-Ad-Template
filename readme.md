# iBec Creative Sketch Ad Template

This sketch template aims to make the process of ad design and creation easier, this template is meant to be a starting point to create your own unique ad designs in a streamlined manner.

We want to install this sketch file as a template so that any time you need to create a new set of ads, this can be used as a starting point with 5 ad sets to create from.

This can be done in only a few steps.

2. Navigate to the finder.
3. From the menu bar, click 'GO', and then click `Go To Folder`.
4. In the text input that appears paste the following text into it: `~/Library/Application Support/com.bohemiancoding.sketch3/Templates`, then click enter.
5. A new finder window will appear, this is the destination for the sketch template.

## Creating a new set of ads from the template.

Creating a new set of ads is done by opening Sketch; clicking on the `File Menu->New From Template`, and clicking on `iBec Display Ad Template`.

## How to use the template

There are 3 sections to the template, organized into 3 columns.

1. The left hand column contains the Ad Setup Variables. Each row of variables corresponds directly to the ad designs to the right of them.
2. The middle column contains the ads themselves, when you update the variables to the left with your image, text, title and color, the ads to the right dynamically change. Each ad-set has a basic layout, feel free to change the layout as needed, this is meant to be a starting point for your great ads.
3. The right column contains extras, currently there are App Store Badges, and some custom frames.
